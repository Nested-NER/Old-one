The fight is a central theme of the contest to head the Democratic National , particularly between two leading candidates : former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean , who supports abortion rights , and former Indiana Rep. Tim Roemer , an abortion foe who argues that the party cannot rebound from its losses in the November election unless it shows more tolerance on one of society 's most emotional conflicts .
