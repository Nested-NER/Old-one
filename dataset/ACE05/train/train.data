officials say they capped one blaze , leaving only two wells still burning out of 500 oil fields in the area. they say some iraqis who worked in the field before the war already are asking for their jobs back. and these pictures show iraqis running for cover just before u.s. planes dropped a bomb near northern iraq. just as they disappear over the ridge , you can hear the planes and the explosions and then you see the cloud .

Will Vehrs 2005-02-27T12:38:00 Governor Mark Warner has turned state government upside-down in an effort to do more business with small , women , and minority owned ( SWAM ) firms and the thanks he gets are headlines like this one in the Daily Press : Warner 's plan to raise contracting diversity falls short .

The " Twin Deficits " Myth

I believe they 're referring to the budget deficit and ... the capital surplus ?
PRP VBP PRP VBP VBG TO DT NN NN CC : DT NN NN .

When analyzing trade deficits , it 's important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the US .

So the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from US consumers ( who control about 20 % of global GDP ) and everybody else ( excluding the non-consumption share of US GDP , that would amount to around 75 % of global GDP ) .

Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported goods , the largest pressure on the deficit is that we 're simply a better place for investment -- higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they face .

So , not to be a heretic , but 1 ) We 're issuing them at relatively low interest rates , 2 ) Inflation is bound to pick up eventually , and so 3 ) Would n't you rather have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by non-US investors , rather than raising taxes in America ?

Having a combined CEO / Chairman does reduce the ability of the board to act as a check on management and this does mean that you need to be more critical in your assessment of the trustworthiness of the top management team .

This downside of having a combined CEO / chair is offset by ( 1 ) a reduction of coordination and communication costs at the top of the organization and ( 2 ) an increase in the negotiating position of the CEO when dealing with suppliers , potential merger partners , etc. # 2 could be particularly useful in a dynamic industry .
