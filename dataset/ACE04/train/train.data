WASHINGTON ( AP ) _ Republicans give George W. Bush credit for promoting a Russian role in smoothing the transition from despot to democrat in Yugoslavia _ an idea dismissed in debate as risky by Al Gore even as his boss was trying to get Moscow to step in .

Intensifying their assault on Gov. George W.

Swarms of jellyfish consumed so many fish eggs and larvae in the Gulf of Mexico this summer that some scientists are talking about the potential for serious future threats to commercial and recreational fisheries in the northern Gulf .

Scientists say the jellyfish are exploiting three major human-induced changes in the environment : thousands of oil rigs and artificial reefs established to attract game fish have greatly increased the breeding habitat for jellyfish , which need a hard surface for spawning ; nitrogen pollution from farm runoff and industrial sources feeds plankton blooms , providing extra food for jellyfish ; and commercial fishermen take great numbers of menhaden , a soft-finned , bony fish that competes with jellyfish for the plankton .

That line of thinking played a big role in the 379-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average and the 93-point drop in the Nasdaq composite index on Oct. 12 _ the day that a Palestinian mob mauled two Israeli soldiers , Israel retaliated with rocket attacks and terrorists blew a hole in a United States warship in Yemen .

The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday , Nov. 16 : The last U.S. president to visit Vietnam was Richard Nixon , who traveled to the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon in 1969 , at the height of a war that eventually took 58,000 American and 3 million Vietnamese lives .

MOSCOW ( AP ) _ Russian lawmakers on Friday overwhelmingly approved the Soviet anthem as Russia 's national hymn _ a move praised by some as a gesture of reconciliation and denounced by others as a symbolic approval of the nation 's totalitarian past .

A research company is proposing that `` points of presence '' are what matter , at least when it comes to online marketing .

The company , Word of Net , is introducing a system meant to measure the various points at which computer users are exposed to Web sites , wherever those exposures may occur .

The measurement system , called the visibility index , is intended to provide information beyond the tracking of traffic to a site by tracking the exposure to sites through search engines , keyword inquiries , listings , links from other sites and category listings in online directories .

TORONTO _ Unwilling to fight a counterbid that so far is only speculation , C.I. Fund Management Inc. has scrapped a $2.5 billion hostile takeover attempt of a larger rival , the Mackenzie Financial Corp. , along with its hope of combining the two Toronto companies to form Canada 's largest mutual-fund empire .

Although C.I. Fund 's cash-and-stock offer , made six weeks ago , was almost 40 percent higher than the price of Mackenzie shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange , Mackenzie management quickly branded the offer `` opportunistic '' and activated a poison pill , a strategy that makes a hostile bid prohibitively expensive , to give it more time to find other buyers .

there is n't a national poll in the race between vice president al gore and governor george w. bush that shows a clear advantage for one or the other with two weekends to go. according to today 's msnbc / reuters tracking poll , gore is hanging onto a two-point lead over bush for the second day in a row. but all these polls , it 's important to point out , are within a margin of error that could flip the results .

Today Wednesday , the judges in charge of looking into the Lockerbie case in Camp Zeist ( Holland ) were faced with an awkward problem : how to deal with a witness who is refusing to answer questions and who is at the same time serving a life sentence and who is not subject to Scottish law ?
