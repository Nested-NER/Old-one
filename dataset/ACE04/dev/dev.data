In 1997 , Mexico 's total amount of foreign trade broke through 220 billion US dollars , which created a new historical record .

However , in reviewing Mexico 's foreign trade situation this year , it might be appropriate to say that it is between joy and sorrow .
RB , IN VBG NNP POS JJ NN NN DT NN , PRP MD VB JJ TO VB IN PRP VBZ IN NN CC NN .

The joy lies in that the total amount of foreign trade still maintains a strong growth momentum , and has realized trade surpluses for the third year in a row , whereas the sorrow is that the amount of trade surplus has sharply reversed , and this year , a relatively large deficit may appear .

According to official journals published recently by Mexico 's Treasury Department , in 1997 , foreign trade continues to grow at high speed , the total amount of imports and exports reached 220.178 billion US dollars , 18.85 % higher than that of the previous year , among which the amount of exports is 110.38 billion US dollars , imports were 109.798 billion US dollars , being 15 % and 22.7 % higher than that of 1996 respectively .

At present , exports account for more than 30 % of its GDP , which is one of the primary economic growth forces .

After the outbreak of Mexico 's financial crisis in 1994 , Mexico 's currency , the peso was greatly devalued , thus greatly strengthening Mexico 's export competitiveness .

In 1995 , the situation of successive foreign trade deficit reversed , and up to now , has maintained trade surpluses for three years in a row .

However , in the past three years , Mexico 's foreign trade surplus showed a substantial degradation : 7.889 billion US dollars in 1995 , 6.424 billion US dollars in 1996 , and only 582 million US dollars last year .

Especially deserving to be pointed out is that , after the first monthly deficit in July last year , the rest of the year saw successive monthly deficits with the amounts of deficit almost doubling , roaring from 20 million US dollars in July to 722 million US dollars in December , reducing the 1997 annual accumulative trade surplus amount to a trivial number .

Local economic analysts felt that the trade deficit in the second half of last year was mainly due to an overly high import growth rate , which is even higher than that of exports .

IN DT JJ NN IN JJ NN , DT JJ NN NN IN NNS VBD CD NN TO CD NN JJR IN DT IN NNS .


Among import sectors , swift growth comes mainly from imports of consumer products and capital goods , 39.9 % and 38.2 % higher than that of 1996 respectively .

The growth of imports of semi-finished products was up by 18.8 % .
DT NN IN NNS IN JJ NNS VBD RP IN CD NN .


Secondly , the overly high valuation of the peso is also an indispensable factor .
RB , DT RB JJ NN IN DT NN VBZ RB DT JJ NN .


An overly high peso exchange rate stimulated imports , but hindered exports .

It is commonly known that in 1994 , before the outbreak of the financial crisis , the trade deficit was once as high as more than 18 billion US dollars .

The huge trade deficit was one of the internal reasons that triggered this crisis .

Hence , the trade situation last year has caused extreme concern among people from economic circles , who even predicted that in 1998 , foreign trade deficit would revive .

For instance , Asian currency devaluation will decrease export competitiveness , and the fall of oil price will significantly reduce oil revenues .

Under these circumstances , if the import growth momentum cannot be restrained , this year , a trade deficit of 4 to 5 billion US dollars may appear .

Scientists have suspected there must be something different about the genetic make up of diabetics who develop complications ; and that difference may have to do with haptoglobin , a protein whose function is to mop up blood vessel destroying free radicals .

Yes indeed , it was a political idea put forward in the writings of the and another very famous french political observer Alexis de Tocqueville who visited America and wrote an amazingly good book about American democracy , said exactly that , that America seemed to him to be the single country in the world who has managed to apply the separation of powers between the judiciary , the executive , and the legislative in a better way than any other country .
